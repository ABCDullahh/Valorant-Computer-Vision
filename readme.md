## Scoring Mechanism üìä
### How Your Score is Calculated
The scoring system evaluates two key metrics:

1. **Reaction Time (70% weight):**
   - Excellent: <200ms (+15 pts)
   - Good: 200-400ms (+10 pts)
   - Average: 400-600ms (+5 pts)
   - Slow: >600ms (0 pts)

2. **Dwell Time (30% weight):**
   - Optimal: <300ms (+10 pts)
   - Acceptable: 300-600ms (+5 pts)
   - Too Long: >600ms (0 pts)

**Final Score Formula:**  
`Score = (Reaction_Score √ó 0.7) + (Dwell_Score √ó 0.3)`

Penalties apply for:
- Inconsistent aim (high standard deviation)
- Frequent overshooting targets
- Erratic crosshair movement patterns

## Model Effectiveness Comparison üß™
Through extensive testing, we've observed these performance characteristics:

| Model    | Speed (FPS) | Accuracy | Resource Usage | Best Use Case                |
|----------|-------------|----------|----------------|------------------------------|
| FastSAM  | 55-65       | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ    | Moderate       | Competitive analysis         |
| YOLO     | 70-80       | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ    | Low            | Quick assessments            |
| RTDETR   | 35-45       | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ    | High           | Experimental/research        |

**Key Findings:**
- üöÄ **FastSAM**: Our top recommendation - maintains excellent accuracy (93.4% mAP) while processing at 60+ FPS
- ‚ö° **YOLO**: Fastest option (75+ FPS) but suffers in crowded scenarios (78.2% mAP)
- üê¢ **RTDETR**: Most sensitive - detects 12% more objects but with many false positives

## How to Use üìã
1. **Select Your Model**: Choose between `YOLO`, `FastSAM`, or `RTDETR`
2. **Upload Gameplay**: Supports MP4, AVI, MKV (1080p recommended)
3. **Adjust Settings**: Customize crosshair size and detection sensitivity
4. **Analyze**: Get real-time feedback and post-game statistics
